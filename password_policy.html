<strong>Organisation:</strong> Clevertel SA Group<br>
<strong>CIPC Registration Number:</strong> 2025/960201/07<br>
<strong>Effective Date:</strong> 20 December 2025<br>
<strong>Version:</strong> 001.2025
</p>

<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>
This policy defines how Clevertel SA Group securely generates, stores, transmits, and manages passwords and authentication credentials. The objective is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of client and internal systems in alignment with POPIA and ISO/IEC 27001 best practices.
</p>

<h2>2. Scope</h2>
<p>
This policy applies to all clients, employees, contractors, and third parties who interact with Clevertel SA Group systems or receive credentials for services including (but not limited to):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email hosting</li>
  <li>Virtual PBX (vPBX)</li>
  <li>Bulk SMS platforms</li>
  <li>Web hosting and domains</li>
  <li>Managed IT services</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Secure Credential Delivery Standard</h2>
<p>
Clevertel SA Group <strong>does not transmit passwords</strong> via email, SMS, WhatsApp, telephone, or any other insecure communication channel.
</p>
<p>
All newly provisioned or reset credentials are delivered exclusively through the Clevertel SA Group Vaultwarden organisation:
</p>
<p>
<strong>🔐 Vault:</strong> <a href="https://passvault.clevertel.co.za" target="_blank">https://passvault.clevertel.co.za</a>
</p>

<h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clients must accept the Vaultwarden invitation and securely access credentials.</li>
  <li>Clients are responsible for securing their own devices, browsers, networks, and user accounts.</li>
  <li>Passwords must be changed immediately upon first login where technically possible.</li>
  <li>Credential sharing outside approved secure systems is strictly prohibited.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Non-Managed Devices – Client Negligence Waiver</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>
Clevertel SA Group <strong>does not manage, control, or secure client-owned or client-operated devices</strong>, including but not limited to personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, home routers, or third-party systems not covered under a managed services agreement.
</p>
<p>
The client expressly acknowledges and agrees that Clevertel SA Group shall <strong>not be held liable</strong> for any credential compromise, unauthorised access, data breach, or loss arising from:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Malware, viruses, keyloggers, or spyware on client devices</li>
  <li>Weak device security, outdated software, or lack of antivirus protection</li>
  <li>Credential reuse, sharing, or unsafe storage by the client</li>
  <li>Use of public or unsecured networks</li>
  <li>Client failure to follow security guidance provided by Clevertel SA Group</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any such incident shall be deemed <strong>client negligence</strong> and does not constitute a breach, failure, or liability on the part of Clevertel SA Group.
</p>
</div>

<h2>6. Managed Devices – Limited Liability</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>
For purposes of this policy, <strong>"Managed Devices"</strong> refers strictly to client devices that are formally enrolled, monitored, and controlled through Clevertel SA Group–approved cloud-based management and security platforms. This includes, but is not limited to:

  <li>Comodo / Xcitium MDM or endpoint security platforms</li>
  <li>Syncro / Synology C2 / comparable RMM or device management platforms</li>
  <li>Any other cloud-managed endpoint solution explicitly agreed to in writing</li>
</ul>
<p>
Only devices actively enrolled and reporting within such platforms, under an active Managed IT Services Agreement, shall be considered <strong>Managed Devices</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Liability shall be limited strictly to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scope of services explicitly defined in the signed Managed IT Services Agreement</li>
  <li>Reasonable technical and organisational safeguards implemented through the approved management platforms</li>

</ul>
<p>
Liability, where applicable, shall be limited to direct damages only and shall exclude indirect, consequential, or loss-of-profit claims, to the maximum extent permitted by South African law.
</p>
</div>

<h2>7. Refusal of Insecure Requests</h2>
<p>
Clevertel SA Group reserves the absolute right to refuse any request to transmit passwords or sensitive credentials through insecure channels. Such refusal shall be considered a lawful and reasonable security control and shall not constitute a service failure or breach of contract.
</p>

<h2>8. POPIA & ISO 27001 Compliance</h2>
<p>
This policy supports compliance with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protection of Personal Information Act, 4 of 2013 (POPIA)</li>
  <li>ISO/IEC 27001 – Annex A (Access Control & Information Security Operations)</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Enforcement</h2>
<p>
