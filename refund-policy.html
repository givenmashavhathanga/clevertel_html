    <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Clevertel SA Group provides a combination of digital services (including SaaS and ICT services)
        and resellable physical IT equipment. Refund eligibility is determined by the nature of the
        product or service supplied.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Non-Refundable Digital Services (Once Provisioned)</h2>
    <p>
        Due to the nature of digital and subscription-based services, no refunds shall be issued once
        a service has been provisioned, activated, credited, or made available, whether partially or fully.
    </p>

    <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hosted email services (mailboxes, domains, licenses)</li>
        <li>Virtual PBX / VoIP services</li>

    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Digital services incur immediate and irreversible costs upon
        provisioning and cannot be returned, reversed, or resold. By purchasing or activating such
        services, the client acknowledges that the transaction is final and non-refundable.
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Subscription Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Subscription fees are non-refundable, whether billed monthly, annually, or on a pro rata basis.</li>
        <li>Cancellation prevents future billing only and does not entitle the client to a refund for the current or prior billing periods.</li>
        <li>Pro rata billing may apply at commencement only, where expressly stated in writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Refundable Goods – Resellable IT Equipment</h2>

        <li>Equipment must be unused, undamaged, and in original packaging</li>
        <li>Return requests must be submitted within seven (7) days of delivery, unless otherwise agreed in writing</li>
        <li>Proof of purchase is required</li>
        <li>Software licenses, activation keys, and bundled digital services are non-refundable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

        and may deduct reasonable handling, restocking, or logistics costs where applicable.

        <li>Third-party platform outages or limitations beyond Clevertel SA Group’s control</li>
        <li>Change-of-mind cancellations for digital services</li>
        <li>Failure by the client to utilise provisioned services</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Chargebacks and Payment Reversals</h2>
    <p>
        Unauthorised chargebacks or payment reversals for legitimately provisioned services constitute
        a material breach of contract. Clevertel SA Group reserves the right to suspend or terminate
        services and recover outstanding amounts, including chargeback penalties and administrative costs.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
